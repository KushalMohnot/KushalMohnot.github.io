[Telecom users analytics](https://github.com/KushalMohnot/Telecom-users)

The task is to analyze data for telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget. The task is to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. We have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. The job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more profitable.
